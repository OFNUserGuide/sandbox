# Hub management tips

The OFN team recognise that there is a huge number of aspects to running a food enterprise, using the OFN platform efficiently being one of them.  Hence, in this section, as well as a series of platform-based [How to's](how-tos/) we aim to build a set of resources \(including around [marketing](marketing-tips.md) and [social media](social-media.md)\) for you to turn to for advice.
