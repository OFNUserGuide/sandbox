After completing your [enterprise registration](../register-and-create-your-profile.md) you have an option to be taken directly to the [enterprise settings page](enterprise-settings.md).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/newregister.jpg)

From here you will need to choose the OFN profile which [best matches your business model](../../your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md). **Without this step, your enterprise account will not be created and, hence, your enterprise will remain invisible on our map.**

Open Food Network offers three types of enterprise profiles that will differ depending on whether you are a producer or not, and whether or not you want to open an online shop to sell on the Open Food Network. The profiles types vary a little bit depending on if you are are a producer or not, so we describe them below under two main sections: the profiles for producers and then the profiles for distributors \(or "hubs" in the Open Food Network world :-\)\).

## For Producers

There are three types of profiles for producers:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/prod_choosenew.jpg)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Producer Profile" %}
With this option not only will your enterprise will be visible on the OFN map and to customers searching our platform, but you will be able to manage a product catalog. Your products can be distributed and sold through other enterprises which are part of the OFN network. 

As a 'Producer Profile' you will not be able to manage your own online shop front. For more information on the quick setup guide for this type of profile, [click here](../../quick-start-guides/).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd like to retail your products on an existing online sales platform and just use OFN to increase your visibility then the 'Producer Profile' package is for you!

You can put the link to your online shop in your enterprise description.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Producer shop" %}
#### You would like to sell only your own products on OFN

This option allows you to run a shopfront which retails only those products in your own catalog. Note that 'Producer Shops' can conduct sales through their own shopfront and/or act as a supplier to other shopfronts \(hubs\). 

For more information on the quick setup guide for this type of profile, click [here](../../quick-start-guides/).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Producer Hub \(multi-producer shop\)" %}
#### You would like to sell your products as well as those of other producers / suppliers 

This option allows you to manage a shop which retails both products made by yourself and those made by other local producers.  You can retail products from any Producer who has given you [permission](create-or-connect-with-your-supplying-producers.md) to do so. 

 For more information on the quick setup guide for this type of profile, click [here](../../quick-start-guides/).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## For Non-Producers \(Hubs\)

Two types of profiles are available to non-producers \(distributors / hubs\):

![](../../.gitbook/assets/nonprod_new.jpg)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Non-Producer Profile" %}
With this option your enterprise will be visible on the OFN map and to customers searching our platform. 

For more information on the quick setup guide for this type of profile, click [here](../../quick-start-guides/).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd like to retail products made by a collection of producers on an existing online sales platform and just use OFN to increase your visibility then the 'Non-Producer Profile' package is for you!

You can put the link to your online shop in your enterprise description.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Non-Producer Hub \(Multi-producer shop\)" %}
#### You would like to create an online shop

This option allows you to manage a shop which retails products made by others. You can retail products from any Producer who has given you [permission](create-or-connect-with-your-supplying-producers.md) to do so. 

 For more information on the quick setup guide for this type of profile, [click here](../../quick-start-guides/multi-producers-shop-hub-quick-setup-guide.md).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Changing your profile type

You can change your profile type \(package\) at any time in the future.  ****First log in to your OFN admin account:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/access1%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%281%29.jpg)

and then visit your [Enterprise Settings menu](enterprise-settings.md). From the table, select the correct option\(s\) from the drop down menus.  \(You will need to be the '[Owner](enterprise-settings.md#users)' of the enterprise to do this.\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/enterprisetable.jpg)

## Next step

Once you have chosen the correct profile type for your food business you can complete any missing information and further refine your setup under the [Enterprise Settings](enterprise-settings.md) menu.
